  abstract  = {The history of neural networks can be traced back to the work of trying to model the neuron. Today, neural networks discussions are occurring everywhere. Neural networks, with their remarkable ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data, can be used to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques. A brief history of the neural networks research is presented and some more popular models are briefly discussed. The major attention is on the feed-forward networks and specially to the topology of such the network and method of building the multi-layer perceptrons.},

  abstract  = {This paper argues that inferences about the true values of parameters logically proceed via the expectation of the log likelihood. In particular, the true values maximise the expected log likelihood. So the estimation problem is to estimate these maximising values. Only for a single parameter, or for special forms of the likelihood function, is this the same as maximising the likelihood. A modification to the maximum likelihood procedure is proposed and simple examples are used to suggest that the modification has advantages, besides being intuitively plausible.},
